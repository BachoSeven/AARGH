# AARGH

Hi! This is my bootstrapping script, which I use to setup a new Arch machine (I usually use [Anarchy](https://anarchyinstaller.org "anarchy"), but installing as few packages as possible so it's very usable on any fresh Arch install.

## Instructions
``` sh
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BachoSeven/AARGH/master/aargh.sh
sudo sh aargh.sh
```

Feel free to ask anything and/or contribute!
