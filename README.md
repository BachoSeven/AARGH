# AARGH

Hi! This is a bootstrapping script which I use to setup an Arch machine (usually with [Anarchy](https://anarchyinstaller.org "anarchy") and installing very few packages, so it should be usable on any new Arch install).

## Instructions
``` sh
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BachoSeven/AARGH/master/aargh.sh
sudo sh aargh.sh
```

Feel free to ask anything and/or contribute!
